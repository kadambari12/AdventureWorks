# AdventureWorks

Adventure Works Cycles, the company on which the Adventure Works sample databases are based, is a large, multinational manufacturing company. 
Adventure Works Cycles is looking to broaden its market share by targeting their sales to their best customers, extending their product availability through an external Web site,
and reducing their cost of sales through lower production costs.

I analysed Adventure Works database using POWER BI tool. 
Before creating Reports and Dashboards, I have created Data Model by joining tables and making relationship between tables and created some calculated field.
After the Data Model and Relation between tables established, I have created Beautiful Charts like Combination Chart, Line Chart, Pareto Chart, Cross Tab, Donut Chart,  
Top N chart, Advanced Funnel Chart, Bump Chart, KPI worksheet etc.

Finally Using all the charts and graphs, I have created Dynamic and Interactive Adventure Work Sales Dashboard.
In this Sales Dashboard, I have also used different action buttons like Back and Next Button, Clear Filter Button and Download Button(which is currently Not working).
